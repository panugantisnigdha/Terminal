# What are flags:
Flags are characters that are used to pass along with commands to modify their behaviour. Ex:

- ls -l
- ls -a
- ls -la
# Manual Command
- Each command has its manual which tells the user about the functionality of the command. In short written as 'man'. Ex:

- man ls (Manual for ls command)
- man mkdir (Manual for mkdir command)
